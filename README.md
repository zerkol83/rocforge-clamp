Clamp — Runtime Stabilization & Environment Anchoring Module for ROCForge

Clamp is a foundational subsystem in the ROCForge toolchain designed to provide deterministic runtime anchoring, environmental consistency, and fault-tolerant state control for heterogeneous compute pipelines.

Where ROCForge orchestrates large-scale GPU/CPU workloads, Clamp acts as its stabilizer — detecting, isolating, and controlling volatile runtime states that arise from entropy-driven scheduling, thread divergence, or inconsistent memory visibility across the ROCm stack.

Clamp exposes a simple C++20 API (ClampAnchor) that lets higher-level modules “lock” execution environments, synchronize memory anchors, and safely “release” them once integrity checks pass. Internally it leverages ROCm primitives (HIP streams, rocBLAS handles) and custom vector semantics to enforce reproducible state transitions even under stochastic or entropy-weighted scheduling.

The project’s immediate goals are:

Runtime Anchoring: Create a low-overhead mechanism for pinning execution contexts and preventing temporal drift between CPU–GPU compute phases.

Entropy Management: Integrate entropy tracking for controlled randomness, ensuring repeatable outcomes in deterministic simulations.

Integration Readiness: Serve as a drop-in subsystem for the broader ROCForge engine, supporting both developer debugging and production-grade runtime validation.

Long-term, Clamp will form the backbone of ROCForge’s stabilization layer — bridging experimental GPU-accelerated logic with predictable, auditable runtime control suitable for both academic reproducibility and commercial reliability.
