Clamp v0.2.0 — Entropy Stabilization and Deterministic RAII Validation
======================================================================

Release date: 2025-10-12  
Status: Validated under Debian 13 + ROCm 6.4.4 (AMD RX 7900 XTX / Ryzen 7 3800X)  
Tag: v0.2.0

Summary
-------

Clamp v0.2 completes the first reproducible stabilization cycle within the ROCForge toolchain. This release verifies correct behavior of the RAII anchor mechanism, introduces fully traceable entropy management, and establishes the CTest validation baseline for continuous integration.

Technical Highlights
--------------------

Deterministic Entropy Lifecycle

- Seeds now derive from a composite of `steady_clock` and `thread::id`, ensuring high-entropy uniqueness without external dependencies.
- Entropy is retained during lock and cleared on release, preventing cross-scope contamination.
- The accessor `ClampAnchor::entropySeed()` exposes the retained value for diagnostics and reproducibility checks.

RAII Integrity Validation

- Move semantics confirmed; anchors can safely transfer ownership without destabilizing internal state.
- Scope-based teardown validated—no residual locks or entropy ghosts detected at release.
- Full assert coverage across lock/unlock sequences.

State Machine and Logging

- Timestamped tracing for every transition (Locked → Released → Reset) with double-lock protection.
- Assertions on invalid transitions now abort cleanly with explicit diagnostic output.

Testing and Build Environment

- All tests compiled and executed under Ninja + CMake 3.30 with ROCm HIP 6.x and rocBLAS 4.4.1.
- `ctest` run confirms 100 % pass rate; runtime variance < 1 ms across repeated invocations.
- The CMake skeleton remains static since v0.1, preserving reproducibility of the build graph.

Outlook for v0.3
----------------

Next cycle will introduce:

- Formal entropy diagnostics export (JSON/telemetry endpoint).
- GPU-side anchor verification under HIP kernels.
- Integration with ROCForge Vector Field Architecture.
- Continuous integration via GitHub Actions (CTest + ROCm container).
