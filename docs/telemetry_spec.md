# Clamp Telemetry Specification (v0.4)

This document defines the JSON schema exported by `EntropyTelemetry::writeJSON` and the collection procedure used by Clamp v0.4. Telemetry snapshots are written to `build/telemetry/clamp_run_<timestamp>.json` during validation and continuous integration workflows.

## Record Schema

Each JSON document contains a single object with the top-level property `stability_score` (the arithmetic mean of all recorded stability scores) and the property `records`, an array of anchor events. Every element of the array adheres to the following structure:

| Field            | Type    | Description                                                                                  |
|------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `context`        | string  | Logical name of the anchor (e.g., thread id or subsystem).                                   |
| `seed`           | number  | 64-bit entropy seed captured at lock acquisition.                                            |
| `thread_id`      | string  | Host thread identifier that acquired the anchor.                                             |
| `acquired_at`    | string  | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp marking lock acquisition.                                             |
| `released_at`    | string \| null | ISO-8601 UTC timestamp for anchor release; `null` if the anchor is still in-flight.   |
| `duration_ms`    | number  | Measured lock duration in milliseconds (0.000 precision).                                   |
| `stability_score`| number  | Normalized (0.0â€“1.0) stability metric associated with the anchor cycle.                      |

## Collection Procedure

1. `ClampAnchor::lock` registers an acquisition event with the process-local `EntropyTelemetry` instance, capturing the entropy seed, thread id, and acquisition timestamp.
2. `ClampAnchor::release` finalises the record, computing duration and assigning a stability score (current implementation emits `1.0` for successful cycles).
3. Integration and tests invoke `EntropyTelemetry::writeJSON()` to serialize accumulated records into `build/telemetry/`.
4. Continuous integration workflows archive `build/telemetry/` alongside the compiled test binaries for reproducibility analysis.

## Reproducibility Criteria

- All timestamps are reported in UTC and may be aligned post-hoc via `EntropyTelemetry::alignToReference`.
- Entropy seeds must remain non-zero for valid anchors; zero values indicate failed acquisition and should be flagged.
- Stability scores are constrained to `[0.0, 1.0]`. Values outside the range constitute telemetry corruption.
- Telemetry files must be preserved as CI artifacts for every tagged release. Validation scripts may inspect aggregate stability using `jq '.stability_score' build/telemetry/*.json` or per-record data with `jq '.records[].stability_score' build/telemetry/*.json`.

Future revisions will extend the schema with distributed node identifiers and probabilistic scoring metadata as the ROCForge reproducibility framework evolves.

## Summary Artifact

`TemporalAggregator` consumes all session files beneath `build/telemetry/` and emits `build/telemetry_summary.json` with the following top-level fields:

| Field              | Type   | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sourceDirectory`  | string | Absolute directory scanned for session logs (also exported as `source_directory`). |
| `sessionCount`     | number | Total count of aggregated telemetry records (legacy alias `session_count`). |
| `meanStability`    | number | Arithmetic mean of all stability scores, fixed to six decimal places (`mean_stability`). |
| `variance`         | number | Sample variance of the stability scores derived from Welford running stats (`stability_variance`). |
| `driftPercentile`  | number | 95th percentile of recorded lock durations in milliseconds (`drift_index`). |

Legacy snake_case properties remain in the payload for backward compatibility with pre-v0.5 tooling, but downstream consumers should migrate to the camelCase equivalents introduced in Phase 2. The summary file is meant for longitudinal analysis and accompanies the raw session logs in release artifacts and CI uploads.
